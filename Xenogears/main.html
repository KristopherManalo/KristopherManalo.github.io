		Introduction
		</h3>
			<p>
			Near the end of second semester senior year I remembered Xenogears, I do not know the exact reason why.
			My memory of it was imperfect but I did remember that the story was deeper that what I knew. Eventually
			I grew the inspiration to replay it and eventually I did. I went in with some hesitation as I was afraid
			that the game would be worse than I remembered. I was wrong as my love for the game was greatly improved
			by replaying it. Dare I say, it may be my favorite game right now. Xenogears is not perfect, and is nowhere
			near perfection.
			</p>
			<h5>Disclaimer: Skip past the Plot Synopsis and Characters section, potentially themes as they are not necesarry for my review of the game.</h5>

		<h3>
		Plot Synopsis
		</h3>
			<p>
			The plot is convoluted, however it holds beauty in its soft worldbuilding within a world that is completely developed
			and understood from the heads of Takashi and Soraya Saga. The use of soft worldbuilding cannot not be properly expressed
			in this synopsis, rather only experienced by playing the game. I don't recommend reading this synopsis if you want to play the game
			If you truly want to play this game, play the game with zero story knowledge, but feel free to use guides to navigate the
			dated game mechanics. Once you let the first playthrough ferment a little bit, read <i>Xenogears: Perfect Works</i>, or at least
			look over it. Take in the hard worldbuilding that Takahashi and Soraya Saga prepared and built their world and story around. 
			And then, eventually, replay the game. Pay closer attention to the mechanics of the story, and the foreshadowing and the structure
			of the world and its parallels, attempt to synthesize the meaning of the world with your own knowledge before you listen to anyone
			else's understanding of Xenogears. This game is beautiful and far too comprehensive for its own good and should instead
			be enjoyed exclusively through a personal perspective.

			<h4>
			Eldrige Crash
			</h4>
				<div>
				<p>
				At some point before the start of the game, humanity found the Zohar, a generator of sorts with infinite
				energy. The Zohar saw all potential futures and controlled it. Within it was trapped the Wave Existence,
				an entity that was beyond the limitations of the third dimensional world. Humanity weaponized the Zohar, using
				the limitless potential to create <em>Deus</em>. <em>Deus</em> was an extremely effect weapon. Capable of
				invading planets, growing itself, and then take over the planet. <em>Deus</em> eventually went overboard and
				humanity dubbed the weapon far too destructive. The then ruling power of the universe placed a weakened <em>Deus</em>
				on a Passenger Ship called the "Eldridge." The Zohar was a vital part of <em>Deus</em> so it too was placed on the ship.
				On the Eldridge, a young boy named Abel found the Zohar and desperately wished for a mother. His wish instilled upon
				the trapped Wave Existence a will to nurture humanity, the Existence had two vital parts: its incomprehensible
				power and its unstoppable will. <em>Deus</em> aware of his impending doom activated itself and
				took control of the ship, crashing the ship into a nearby planet and killing all inhabitants on the ship except
				for Abel. <em>Deus</em> was now heavily damaged by the crash and activated a self-preservation function called -Persona-
				that would grow the mass vital for its survival. To create the mass that would become one with <i>Deus</i>,
				it created the mother of all humanity from the biological machine, called the Kadomony, from the eye of the Zohar. 
				Within the mother, <i>Deus</i> placed a will that would work towards the sole preservation of <i>Deus</i>.
				This mother was the first Elly and the first Myyah, at this point conjoined entities. The Kadomony then produced the first humans
				Cain and the members of the Gazel Ministry, who were born with two purposes. To serve as the origin of humanity
				and to hold the Animus.
				</p>
				<p>
				When <i>Deus</i> crashed onto the planet and activated -Persona- it placed around the world 12 Anima relics
				which were destined to combine with the 12 Animus of the Gazel Ministry. And humanity expanded from the 13 seeds
				of Cain and the Animus. But wandering the world alone, was Abel. With the seeds of the -Persona- now in place
				Myyah seperated from Elly, and Elly found herself upon Abel, beginning the curse of the Contact, the Antitype,
				and the Supplement representing Abel, Elly, and Myyah respectively. Where the three componets were forced
				to be reincarnated and permeate humanity endlessly until the day <i>Deus</i> was revived.
				During this incarnation, Elly served to Abel a motherly role
				fulfilling the wish that Abel made upon the Zohar on the Eldridge.
				</p>
				<p>
				Cain, the first human born from <i>Deus</i> held incredible power, and the early humans revered
				him as a God. During this era, Cain hunted down Abel and Elly, where Elly sacrificed herself for
				Abel's survival, requestion for him to "...Live!"
				</p>
				<p>
				As the Contact and the Antitype, Abel's reincarnations and Elly's reincarnations were destined
				to have a strong relationship between the two beings, initially formed as a mother and a son
				but later due to their close ages of iterations, often became lovers.
				</p>
				</div>
			<h4>
			Zeboim
			</h4>
				<div>
				<p>
				Much later, humanity was given its time to grow scientificly, and they peaked as a species.
				However, two things plagued humantiy, their desire for bloodshed and their genetic damage.
				Wars were constant during this era, and peace was seldom. Additionally, human lives were capping
				at 30 years and many humans became infertile. Humanity was dying and they were accelerating 
				their doom with constant war. During this period, Abel and Elly were reincarnated into a man named Kim Kasim
				and a woman dubbed Elly.
				</p>
				<p>
				Kim Kasim was frusturated with the nature of humanity and their constant infighting, he believed that everyone
				was foolish. He was an incredibly smart man and with the help of Elly, his now wife, he worked on creating
				a solution for humanity. The entity that sponsored his research was Myyah, who saw value in Kim's research
				for the goal of the revival of <i>Deus</i>. Kim Kasim created nanomachines and gave a consciousness
				to a colony of his nanomachines. The colony featured green hair and he decided to name it Emeralda.
				Emeralda became Kim and Elly's surrogate daughter, embracing the Kasim surname. Eventually, Myyah plotted
				for an invasion of Kim and Elly's lab to harness nanomachine technology. When the armed forced arrived for the invasion,
				Elly sacrificed herself to protect Kim and Emeralda from the hands of Myyah, requesting that they both "...Live!"
				</p>
				<p>
				Her efforts weren't in vain, and the country of Zeboim, where this era occured, crumbled down and with it all
				knowledge of Emeralda Kasim. While Zeboim crumbled, humanity continued to live and survived past their genetic issues,
				the world experienced a sort of soft reset in terms of technology with all technology now deep in the ground.
				</p>
				</div>
			<h4>
			Shevat and Solaris
			</h4>
				<div>
				<p>
				Over the next 3000 years, humanity's technology had a soft reset and humanity redeveloped its civilization
				from scratch. Within this era, a country was created named Solaris with its head of government being Cain and
				the Gazel Ministry. A country named Shevat, led by Queen Zephyr and its elders, rose to oppose Solaris aided by another country called Nisan.
				Within Nisan there was the Nisan Sect a religion that focused on the light within each individual with
				leader of the religion called "Mother Sophia" this era's Elly. This era's Contact was named "Lacan."
				This era's contact and antitype held romantic feelings toward each other that manifested while they
				were both young, however it was unexplored. Holding love towards Mother Sophia was another man named Krellian,
				an intelligent man who was in charge of Elly's persoanal guard.
				</p>
				<p>
				The war between Shevat and Solaris was ongoing, however Shevat and with Nisan's aid, was managing
				to hold back against Solaris. However Shevat had a fear; they feared that they would lose their power
				over the rest of humanity. So the elders of Shevat held a deal with Solaris. Shevat would give Mother Sophia
				to Solaris and Solaris would ensure that Shevat would continue to hold power in the world. Shevat's desire for
				power was their original sin that would dictate how they would approach world into the future, and damn Zephyr
				and its elder's to eternal life until they atoned for their sin.
				</p>
				<p>
				At the critical moment to which Shevat would give to Solaris the Nisan Sect's leader, Solaris surrounded Lacan, Krellian, 
				and Zehpyr. Mother Sophia boarded her flagship and crashed herself into the Solaris' fleet to allow Lacan and her people
				to live another day, requesting for Lacan to "...Live!"
				</p>
				<p>
				Lacan, Krellian, and Zephyr were all distraught by Sophia's sacrifice. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Upon Sophia's death, Lacan was defeated. He was lost, and floated in the world without purpose. In Shevat, he met
				a woman who was locked up, who reminded him strongly of his Elly—he met Myyah who instilled upon Lacan a new purpose.
				Myyah sent him on a quest for power, so Lacan could bring eradication upon the world. In his search for power, he
				was the first incarnation of the Contact to meet the Wave Existence since Abel. However, without his Antitype, the acquisition
				of the true power of the Contact was incomplete, however, Lacan learned about the true purpose of humanity and its destiny with
				<i>Deus</i>. Upon contact with the Wave Existence, Lacan became Grahf, rather the will to destroy the world lived past the death
				of the mortal body, the will of Grahf continued to float as a curse upon humanity, haunting body to body until the next
				Contact would be reborn and as he permeated through generations, he would bring upon the world dread and pain.
				</p>
				<p>
				Upon Sophia's death, Krelian was defeated. He recalled Sophia's lessons, on how the light of God was within them all,
				however he questioned if all that has happened was truly God's will. He came to a realization, that God was dead, rather
				he hasn't been among mankind for a long time. He placed upon himself that if God would not answer to humanity, he
				would personally create God. He then left behind Shevat and Nisan to fulfill his own machinations.
				</p>
				<p>
				Upon Sophia's death, Zephyr was defeated. She realized how the events spanned from Shevat's cowardice towards
				a changing world. Her regret would grow stronger upon her knowledge of Grahf and Krelian and how their
				digressions were set by Shevat's mistake. Zephyr felt personally responsible for all destruction caused by
				Grahf.
				</p>

			<h4>
			Xenogears
			</h4>
				<div>
				<p>
				However the world continued permeated by two strong wills, Myyah and Grahf. Eventually the next and last carnation of
				the Contact and the Antitype would be born. Fei Fong Wong was born to Khan Wong and Karen Wong; Elehayym Van Houten was
				born to  Erich Van Houten and Medena Van Houten. Fei was born from parents originating from Shevat while Elly was born from parents
				originating from Solaris.
				</p>
				<p>
				While Fei was a young boy, his mother was overtaken by the will of Myyah, and so his once mother performed
				upon Fei experiments to test his potential as the Contact. The actions of Myyah, traumatized the young Fei
				resulting in manifestation of alternate personalities within him that would affect the path and actualization
				of -Persona-.
				</p>
				<p>
				White Elly was a young girl, she entered Jugend, a school for the elite of the elite in Solaris; a school
				only for those who had the potential to become a member of the most powerful military force on the planet.
				However, she could not manifest her full power and was given performance enhancement drugs by researchers, a
				method that has worked on other students of Jugend. However, her powers as the antitype awakened resulting
				in her killing many of her fellow students, a event that traumatized Elly and affected her disposition towards
				her own power.
				</p>
				<p>
				Okay I'm way too lazy to write about the politics of this world and how it relates to the plot. Play the game,
				read the read Xenogears: Perfect Works, replay the game, watch the multi-part analysis of the story and its themes,
				then replay the game. The best way to experience the majesty of the game.
