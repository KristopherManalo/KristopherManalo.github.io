		Introduction
		</h3>
			<p>
			Near the end of second semester senior year I remembered Xenogears, I do not know the exact reason why.
			My memory of it was imperfect but I did remember that the story was deeper that what I knew. Eventually
			I grew the inspiration to replay it and eventually I did. I went in with some hesitation as I was afraid
			that the game would be worse than I remembered. I was wrong as my love for the game was greatly improved
			by replaying it. Dare I say, it may be my favorite game right now. Xenogears is not perfect, and is nowhere
			near perfection.
			</p>
			<h5>Disclaimer: Skip past the Plot Synopsis and Characters section, potentially themes as they are not necesarry for my review of the game.</h5>

		<h3>
		Plot Synopsis
		</h3>
			<p>
			The plot is convoluted, however it holds beauty in its soft worldbuilding within a world that is completely developed
			and understood from the heads of Takashi and Soraya Saga. The use of soft worldbuilding cannot not be properly expressed
			in this synopsis, rather only experienced by playing the game. I don't recommend reading this synopsis if you want to play the game
			If you truly want to play this game, play the game with zero story knowledge, but feel free to use guides to navigate the
			dated game mechanics. Once you let the first playthrough ferment a little bit, read <i>Xenogears: Perfect Works</i>, or at least
			look over it. Take in the hard worldbuilding that Takahashi and Soraya Saga prepared and built their world and story around. 
			And then, eventually, replay the game. Pay closer attention to the mechanics of the story, and the foreshadowing and the structure
			of the world and its parallels, attempt to synthesize the meaning of the world with your own knowledge before you listen to anyone
			else's understanding of Xenogears. This game is beautiful and far too comprehensive for its own good and should instead
			be enjoyed exclusively through a personal perspective.

			<h4>
			Eldrige Crash
			</h4>
				<div>
				<p>
				At some point before the start of the game, humanity found the Zohar, a generator of sorts with infinite
				energy. The Zohar saw all potential futures and controlled it. Within it was trapped the Wave Existence,
				an entity that was beyond the limitations of the third dimensional world. Humanity weaponized the Zohar, using
				the limitless potential to create <em>Deus</em>. <em>Deus</em> was an extremely effect weapon. Capable of
				invading planets, growing itself, and then take over the planet. <em>Deus</em> eventually went overboard and
				humanity dubbed the weapon far too destructive. The then ruling power of the universe placed a weakened <em>Deus</em>
				on a Passenger Ship called the "Eldridge." The Zohar was a vital part of <em>Deus</em> so it too was placed on the ship.
				On the Eldridge, a young boy named Abel found the Zohar and desperately wished for a mother. His wish instilled upon
				the trapped Wave Existence a will to nurture humanity, the Existence had two vital parts: its incomprehensible
				power and its unstoppable will. <em>Deus</em> aware of his impending doom activated itself and
				took control of the ship, crashing the ship into a nearby planet and killing all inhabitants on the ship except
				for Abel. <em>Deus</em> was now heavily damaged by the crash and activated a self-preservation function called -Persona-
				that would grow the mass vital for its survival. To create the mass that would become one with <i>Deus</i>,
				it created the mother of all humanity from the biological machine, called the Kadomony, from the eye of the Zohar. 
				Within the mother, <i>Deus</i> placed a will that would work towards the sole preservation of <i>Deus</i>.
				This mother was the first Elly and the first Myyah, at this point conjoined entities. The Kadomony then produced the first humans
				Cain and the members of the Gazel Ministry, who were born with two purposes. To serve as the origin of humanity
				and to hold the Animus.
				</p>
				<p>
				When <i>Deus</i> crashed onto the planet and activated -Persona- it placed around the world 12 Anima relics
				which were destined to combine with the 12 Animus of the Gazel Ministry. And humanity expanded from the 13 seeds
				of Cain and the Animus. But wandering the world alone, was Abel. With the seeds of the -Persona- now in place
				Myyah seperated from Elly, and Elly found herself upon Abel, beginning the curse of the Contact, the Antitype,
				and the Supplement representing Abel, Elly, and Myyah respectively. Where the three componets were forced
				to be reincarnated and permeate humanity endlessly until the day <i>Deus</i> was revived.
				During this incarnation, Elly served to Abel a motherly role
				fulfilling the wish that Abel made upon the Zohar on the Eldridge.
				</p>
				<p>
				Cain, the first human born from <i>Deus</i> held incredible power, and the early humans revered
				him as a God. During this era, Cain hunted down Abel and Elly, where Elly sacrificed herself for
				Abel's survival, requestion for him to "...Live!"
				</p>
				<p>
				As the Contact and the Antitype, Abel's reincarnations and Elly's reincarnations were destined
				to have a strong relationship between the two beings, initially formed as a mother and a son
				but later due to their close ages of iterations, often became lovers.
				</p>
				</div>
			<h4>
			Zeboim
			</h4>
				<div>
				<p>
				Much later, humanity was given its time to grow scientificly, and they peaked as a species.
				However, two things plagued humantiy, their desire for bloodshed and their genetic damage.
				Wars were constant during this era, and peace was seldom. Additionally, human lives were capping
				at 30 years and many humans became infertile. Humanity was dying and they were accelerating 
				their doom with constant war. During this period, Abel and Elly were reincarnated into a man named Kim Kasim
				and a woman dubbed Elly.
				</p>
				<p>
				Kim Kasim was frusturated with the nature of humanity and their constant infighting, he believed that everyone
				was foolish. He was an incredibly smart man and with the help of Elly, his now wife, he worked on creating
				a solution for humanity. The entity that sponsored his research was Myyah, who saw value in Kim's research
				for the goal of the revival of <i>Deus</i>. Kim Kasim created nanomachines and gave a consciousness
				to a colony of his nanomachines. The colony featured green hair and he decided to name it Emeralda.
				Emeralda became Kim and Elly's surrogate daughter, embracing the Kasim surname. Eventually, Myyah plotted
				for an invasion of Kim and Elly's lab to harness nanomachine technology. When the armed forced arrived for the invasion,
				Elly sacrificed herself to protect Kim and Emeralda from the hands of Myyah, requesting that they both "...Live!"
				</p>
				<p>
				Her efforts weren't in vain, and the country of Zeboim, where this era occured, crumbled down and with it all
				knowledge of Emeralda Kasim. While Zeboim crumbled, humanity continued to live and survived past their genetic issues,
				the world experienced a sort of soft reset in terms of technology with all technology now deep in the ground.
				</p>
				</div>
			<h4>
			Shevat and Solaris
			</h4>
				<div>
				<p>
				Over the next 3000 years, humanity's technology had a soft reset and humanity redeveloped its civilization
				from scratch. Within this era, a country was created named Solaris with its head of government being Cain and
				the Gazel Ministry. A country named Shevat, led by Queen Zephyr and its elders, rose to oppose Solaris aided by another country called Nisan.
				Within Nisan there was the Nisan Sect a religion that focused on the light within each individual with
				leader of the religion called "Mother Sophia" this era's Elly. This era's Contact was named "Lacan."
				This era's contact and antitype held romantic feelings toward each other that manifested while they
				were both young, however it was unexplored. Holding love towards Mother Sophia was another man named Krellian,
				an intelligent man who was in charge of Elly's persoanal guard.
				</p>
				<p>
				The war between Shevat and Solaris was ongoing, however Shevat and with Nisan's aid, was managing
				to hold back against Solaris. However Shevat had a fear; they feared that they would lose their power
				over the rest of humanity. So the elders of Shevat held a deal with Solaris. Shevat would give Mother Sophia
				to Solaris and Solaris would ensure that Shevat would continue to hold power in the world. Shevat's desire for
				power was their original sin that would dictate how they would approach world into the future, and damn Zephyr
				and its elder's to eternal life until they atoned for their sin.
				</p>
				<p>
				At the critical moment to which Shevat would give to Solaris the Nisan Sect's leader, Solaris surrounded Lacan, Krellian, 
				and Zehpyr. Mother Sophia boarded her flagship and crashed herself into the Solaris' fleet to allow Lacan and her people
				to live another day, requesting for Lacan to "...Live!"
				</p>
				<p>
				Lacan, Krellian, and Zephyr were all distraught by Sophia's sacrifice. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Upon Sophia's death, Lacan was defeated. He was lost, and floated in the world without purpose. In Shevat, he met
				a woman who was locked up, who reminded him strongly of his Elly—he met Myyah who instilled upon Lacan a new purpose.
				Myyah sent him on a quest for power, so Lacan could bring eradication upon the world. In his search for power, he
				was the first incarnation of the Contact to meet the Wave Existence since Abel. However, without his Antitype, the acquisition
				of the true power of the Contact was incomplete, however, Lacan learned about the true purpose of humanity and its destiny with
				<i>Deus</i>. Upon contact with the Wave Existence, Lacan became Grahf, rather the will to destroy the world lived past the death
				of the mortal body, the will of Grahf continued to float as a curse upon humanity, haunting body to body until the next
				Contact would be reborn and as he permeated through generations, he would bring upon the world dread and pain.
				</p>
				<p>
				Upon Sophia's death, Krelian was defeated. He recalled Sophia's lessons, on how the light of God was within them all,
				however he questioned if all that has happened was truly God's will. He came to a realization, that God was dead, rather
				he hasn't been among mankind for a long time. He placed upon himself that if God would not answer to humanity, he
				would personally create God. He then left behind Shevat and Nisan to fulfill his own machinations.
				</p>
				<p>
				Upon Sophia's death, Zephyr was defeated. She realized how the events spanned from Shevat's cowardice towards
				a changing world. Her regret would grow stronger upon her knowledge of Grahf and Krelian and how their
				digressions were set by Shevat's mistake. Zephyr felt personally responsible for all destruction caused by
				Grahf.
				</p>
				</div>
			<h4>
			Xenogears
			</h4>
				<div>
				<p>
				However the world continued permeated by two strong wills, Myyah and Grahf. Eventually the next and last carnation of
				the Contact and the Antitype would be born. Fei Fong Wong was born to Khan Wong and Karen Wong; Elehayym Van Houten was
				born to  Erich Van Houten and Medena Van Houten. Fei was born from parents originating from Shevat while Elly was born from parents
				originating from Solaris.
				</p>
				<p>
				While Fei was a young boy, his mother was overtaken by the will of Myyah, and so his once mother performed
				upon Fei experiments to test his potential as the Contact. The actions of Myyah, traumatized the young Fei
				resulting in manifestation of alternate personalities within him that would affect the path and actualization
				of -Persona-.
				</p>
				<p>
				White Elly was a young girl, she entered Jugend, a school for the elite of the elite in Solaris; a school
				only for those who had the potential to become a member of the most powerful military force on the planet.
				However, she could not manifest her full power and was given performance enhancement drugs by researchers, a
				method that has worked on other students of Jugend. However, her powers as the antitype awakened resulting
				in her killing many of her fellow students, a event that traumatized Elly and affected her disposition towards
				her own power.
				</p>
				<p>
				Okay I'm way too lazy to write about the politics of this world and how it relates to the plot. Play the game,
				read the read Xenogears: Perfect Works, replay the game, watch the multi-part analysis of the story and its themes,
				then replay the game. The best way to experience the majesty of the game.
				<br>
				Other characters that exist somewhere in Xenogears and that matter: Bartholomew Fatima, Ricardo Banderas, Billy Lee Black, 
				Maria Balthasar, Chu-Chu (mandatory comedic relief animal thing), Emeralda Kasim, Id, Kahran, Krellian, Grahf, Collective Gazel
				 Ministry, Emperor Cain, Marguerite Fatima, Hammer, The Elements (Dominia Yizkor, Klevena, Tolone, Seraphita), Wave Existence, Wiseman
				 Queen Zephyr, Wisemen.

		Characters
		</h3>
			<p>
			</p>
			<h4>
			The Contact
			</h4>
			<p>
				Fei Fong Wong: <br>
				The one that Contacted God. First incarnation was the lucky individual who happened to be in the right place in the right time. Wished upon the Zohar a mother, and the Zohar
				placed within itself a motherly will that became instrumental to its processes. 
			</p>
			<h4>
			The Antitype
			</h4>
			<p>
				Elehayym Van Houten: <br>
				First incarnation was the product of the first Contacts wish. Initially served as a maternal figure to the Contact, however only existed as someone
				to provide emotional support in the programming of the Demiurge. Hence, any incarnations in the future of the Antitype tended to be the lover of the Contact.
			</p>
			<h4>
			The Supplement
			</h4>
			<p>
				Myyah Hawwa: <br>
				A system created by the demiurge to assist in its regenerative function. Split off from the original Elly, and was destined to one day return
				to her.
			</p>
			<h4>
			The Demon
			</h4>
			<p>
				Grahf, Id: <br>
				Represents the corruption of the Contact, a curse that corrupts the gift of higher power and serves as a curse on humanity.

		The review
		</h3>
			<p>
				I'm going to keep this short. <br>
				<br>
				I can't give the game a number score. The game is not perfect, but it is a masterpiece. The game used its faults to tell a story
				that could only produced with the embrace of its faults. The only true downside is the gameplay. It is aged, honestly, its not good.
				I hated the gameplay sequences, particularily the combat. The world building was incredible, every place used in a cutscene was visitable.
				The music added greatly to the themes of the game, minus a few select situations. The visuals was incredible, the symbolism was great. The artstyle
				while dated, had enough visual clarity. Combined with art direction, the game was beautiful. Light was used incredibly to make Holy places feel more divine.
				The deuteragonists were incredible, my favorite in fiction. However overall, many characters were incomplete, or rather, were useless once their arcs were "done".
				<br>
				I highly recommend the game but I don't think you should play it.

		<h3>
		Ramblings
		</h3>
			<p>
				Skip this part, I wanted to synthesize my ramblings but then it turned into something even worse. <br>
				My favorite part of the game was my experience of rambling about the game. The moment to moment hysteria I experienced as I traveled
				with the characters from scene to scene. Naturally, I wasn't blind, this was a replay, however, I did not remember everything, and I was far too young to
				appreciate the characters when I first played the game. When Fei and Elly shared their moment stranded at see—I read there words, they resonated with me.
				Its sad to say that I relate so much to what Fei and Elly experience, the feeling of drifting, those feelings inside. Fei during the story has found little
				oppertunity for introspection, he was led from event to event by circumstance. Fei, to himself was not a good person, his current goal of saving the people of
				Aveh, was not his goal. He only wanted a place to belong. Fei, during his conversation with Elly, just apologized and hated himself for how he lived his life.
				He felt to himself that he was no good. Elly was a voice against these thoughts, she comforted him in the single moment that he expressed weakness. There was
				certainly an image of masculinity that Fei felt that he had to uphold as a facade when he was drifting through life. Elly understood the perspective of Fei, as
				she too related to the internal pains of Fei, and was able to empathize and provide positivity to the mindset. Where even though they both felt they
				were incomplete, without goals in life, drifters lost in the ocean. Even though they were both incomplete, if they commited themselves to something, anything that
				provided them with any inkling of solace, that in the end, they will find their whole. Together they found such a negative approach to finding happiness, but
				it was something that they could do. When I replayed the game and reached this scene, and I understood the precense of Id and his values. The double meaning of this
				conversation blew my mind. Fei when referring to himself he mentions how he feels deep down, he isn't truly desiring to help. That he is simply no good. He was being
				led by circumstance. And that he is incomplete. All these refer to Id within Fei. Id is the dominant persona of Fei, or rather, the more powerful one. When Fei is in
				control of their body, Id is willingly resting and letting Fei take control. Id has no desire to help people, he is only interested in the pursuit of power as a mechanism
				to cope with the sadness he experiences, so Fei did not truly desire to hlep people. Id was not a good person because the original persona was not a good person. The
				original Fei locked within himself all the happy memories, leaving behind a persona to deal with all the negative baggage. That persona was Id, surely you could
				rationalize the actions of Id as the product of childhood trauma, caused by the calculus of trauma and childhood development, however morally, Id was a bad person.
				Id killed, caused suffering, and found pleasure in ruining. And Fei was being led by circumstance that existed beyond the landscape of war that plagued the world.
				He was part of a system that only existed to perpetuate the life of a biological warmachine. And Fei was incomplete, he was not the person he was born to be,
				within him was trauma that split him apart, he held no memories of his past and existed merely as a tool.

				I forgot what i was typing about, and I refuse to look back. Anyway, the relationship of Fei and Elly was incredible, its quite sad when defined though. They exist
				together merely because the machinations of several entities beyond their scope of existence want them together. You can take this from a meta perspective where Tetsuya
				Takahashi writes them together, and using all his power as the man behind the game to justify them being together, or from the perspective of the game's setting where
				a warmachine causes them to to experience life continiuosly, destined together, due to a chance encounter millions of generations ago, and so became the batteries of the
				warmachiens regeneration.

				My mind is still stuck on the bond between Elly and Fei, the way it is developed is incredible. Their silent moments together defined who they were as people and
				they saw in each other something that was lacking in themselves. But then you realize, that they exist that way because they were programmed to desire each other, and
				its sad, but their emotions towards each other is genuine. I'm so sad that I can't aritculate on it greater since it something that needs to be experienced.

				Xenoblade 3 missed the mark with the relationship between Noah and Mio, its adorable, that I cannot deny, hwowever it lacks the substance and the interaction between
				the two to truly feel strong. I'm not joking that the relationship between Fei and Elly were made more clear to the viewer when the two characters had sex, Xenoblade 3
				could not rely on that so they instead used the pregnancy of a previous Mio incarnation to less directly show the love between teh two characters. It has the same effect,
				but that is a previous incarnation of the characters, not the current so do they truly hold the same bond, I cannot say. Elly and Fei share their bond clearly to the
				viewer several times over their incarnations. The circumstance changes, and the way it is done varies, but they all end the same way. What am I saying???? It's more powerful, I can't really ariticulate it. Oh well,
				Xenoblade 3 tries to characterize Mio and Noah more through M and N and how they exist as antithesis of Mio and Noah, it does something unique, however it falls short
				compared to Xenogears. Xenogears definitely used the lives of previous Fei and Elly to expand on the relationship between the two, but it relied much more on the
				introspection of the Fei and Elly to show their reliance on each other and how they valued one another. The reason Xenogears waas greater was because Xenogears fell short in the first place.

				I now understand why I love Xenogears so mucn. That second disc is a masterpiece because of its shortcomings. The use of the exposition chair is genius, the abstract
				construction of scene and the content. Sure the scenes could be stated as "concept art, characters in a chair, and narration," commiting a massive sin in video games
				of telling rather than showing. However, the human mind can only be extrapolated so much, and with so little time. If the game was the same length and utilized more gameplay
				rather then storytelling, the relationship between Elly and Fei would not be nearly as strong. The game needed the introspection in order to complete the characters, to
				display their symmetry and their differences. One of the first exposition chairs immediately displays the symmetry of their characters.
				<br><br>
				Dreams. . . <br>
				A life of a man named <br>
				Lacan. . . <br>
				And the lives of countless other men. . . <br> 
				<br>
				All but dreams. . .<br>
				<br>
				In those dreams, <br>
				I loved one woman. . . <br>
				No matter the day, <br>
				No matter the era. . . <br>
				That did not change. . . <br>
				<br>
				Nor did her name. . .<br>
				<br><br>
				Elly's version: <br>
				In those dreams, <br>
				I loved one man. . . <br>
				No matter the day, <br>
				No matter the era, <br>
				That did not change. . .<br>
				<br>
				Only his name. . .
				<br><br>
				The symmetry is beautiful they have lived similar lives, cursed with power that dictated their past and their futures. Prior to this, the characters were
				at their lowest, they had just attempted to run away from their responsibilities in the world, however the calculus of greater powers prevented their escape.
				When they were alone together, they were the same, they lived the same. But when the world attempted to bring them back to their purposes, their
				recollection of life events was different. Once their paths diverged, the characterse went down paths similar to their previous carnations, Fei became another seeker of power,
				and Elly became another saviour of the people. Their divergences was caused by the circumstance that led them, that they both had previously shared about when drifting in the ocean.
				It was very interesting how the current Fei and Elly were going down the same path as previous Contact and Antitypes. The previous incarnations are used as tools
				of comparison with the current carnations but it does not rely on them, where Fei and Elly could exist in a vaccuum and they would be the same characters. However, the existance
				of the prevoius incarnations and the viewers ability to analyze the patterns and the history and how it all connects. It makes me gush, its such genius but its so conviluted.

				Eventually comes the moment where the current Fei and Elly have sex prior to the event that likely would have been the climax of a second disc if xenogears was the third disc.
				And Fei does the classic trope of leaving behind his lover to protect her, blah blah blah. Its overused, but it returns to that concept of the toxic masculinity within Fei,
				and his desire to protect Elly. Of course, for plot reasons, Fei and the less important people get defeated and Elly is recieves a nonplayable powerup and attempts to rescue
				Fei and the not important characters. Elly sacrifices herself to the one of 14 different evils present in the story in turn allowing Fei and the other useless characters
				to run free. And Elly becomes one with Myyah the original mother persona of humanity, the persona who's purpose was to raise humanity into cattle that would perpetuate
				the cycle of regeneration for the warmachine. There is a juxtaposition in the expressions of Myyah Elly, Elly, and Elly's previous incarnations, and I enjoy it greatly.
				The portraits in this game are not very detailed, but the subtle change in emotions are obvious but natural looking and help understanding exactly what happened to Elly.
				She is no longer the same person, then exposition dump. I am reading through my experiences I wrote about while playing this game on Discord and I see something
				that perfectly sums up my feelings on the food chain cycle of the world. "so both lacan and fei have experienced the same loss
				both have lost their elly's due to elly's sacrifice
				shitan notes how he sees the same events happening
				the same event of the contact awakening and seeking the power of the zohar
				and in a sense it is true
				id is grahf and fei is lacan
				id is the one who awakens
				and he does seek out the power of the zohar for he desires power to destroy how grahf seeked out the desire of the zohar as vengeance of elly's death"
				For story reasons Fei and Elly both are no longer playable following the events at Deus, and the perspective switches to Shitan, who is an unreliable source
				in normal circumstances, but is known to be incredibly knowledgeable on all events. Shitan provides a reliable and straight forward narration of the events, with
				little introspection on Shitan's thoughts. Wildly different compared to the constant emotional baggage present within Fei and Elly's narration.

				Something I love about this game is the existance of the Xenogears mech. Its a biological machine, akin to how Deus was a biological weapon. The image of the Xenogears
				sitting in a cocoon was beautiful. I loved the precense of the male and female one winged angel who could only fly together. This statue was omnipresent in the story,
				and seen nearly constantly in the final 10 hours of the game. It simple on its meaning however its powerful. The cycle of the world relied on that unity, and the people
				worshipped it.

				This is essentially the end of the game. There is optional post game content where you can make Emeralda grow up and become a better party member. That is where you can see
				a previous carnation of Elly and Fei have sex and see more backstory about Emeralda's creation and her relationship to Kim Kasim. There is much to be desired, however
				that desire will never be fulfilled.

				The end of the game has an animated scene featuring the song Small Two of Pieces ~Screeching Shards~. The Small two of Pieces, Fei and Elly. Two vital pieces of
				a large important system. They are small compared to the world that relies on them, small compared to the benevolent god that created them, small compared to the world
				that exists beyond their love. They are fundamentally, broken people. However, together, they can run to the end of the world, and escape their fate. They screeched
				against the world that worked to contain them and they flew together in hand. They were broken mirrors, fundamentally broken, but they could fly together. The way
				this connects to Elly and Fei's moment at sea, where they mutually understand they are broken people. It brings me chills. Krelian was also a broken person, broken
				by God's lack of action for his life, and attempted to create God. In the end he did and was able to fly by himself, and ascend to a higher realm where a, in a sense,
				more biblical god resided. He turned around, with his abiltiy to fly by himself, and saw the Broken Shards able to fly together and was envious.

				I really liked this game, the visuals, the audio, and the story all worked togehter to tell a brilliant story. I felt sad when I finished the game as I grew incredible love
				for the characters. I was sad that they were gone. Fei and Elly make me feel deep pangs of sadness inside, and I do understand why but I'm afraid to articulate why it does.
